# homdista

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The purpose of homdista is to analyze the movements of objects, such as animals, based on collected GPS coordinates. This package provides several functions to calculate home range areas and distances traveled over months and years.

```
homdista::homdista(): Computes monthly and yearly utilized areas and distances walked.

homdista::homekde(): Generates polygons representing the utilized areas.

homdista::hodicor(): Calculates correlation values and visualizes the relationship between area and distance.

homdista::distwalk(): Creates line paths to visualize the traveled distances.

homdista::moveObject(): Converts a data frame into a move object for more detailed movement analysis.
```

## Installation

You can install the homdista package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("2023Jado/homdista")
```
## To effectively use homdista for data analysis, you will need to install and use the following additional packages
```
library(ggplot2)
library(mapview)
library(tidyr)
library(move)
```
## Example

The following are basic examples for how each of the functions works:

```{r example}
options(warn = -1)
library(homdista)
## Additional packages
library(sp)
library(sf)
library(ade4)
library(adehabitatMA)
library(CircStats)
library(adehabitatLT)
library(adehabitatHR)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyr)

## Home range area (with Kernel density estimator) and walked distance calculation
file <- read.csv("data.csv", header = T)
area_distance <- homdista(file ,"%m/%d/%y %I:%M %p", 32734, "Animal", 90, 500)

head(area_distance)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
